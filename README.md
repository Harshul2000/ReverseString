Here, I reverse a user entered string usig the concept of slicing

The first character in the string has index 0, and the last character has index n-1, where n is the length of the string. The string slicing operator “::” reads all the characters of the string, and -1, in the end, reverses the order of the characters. This is how we can reverse a string.
